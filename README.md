# Spay & Neuter Nation

Website design by Oliver McTammany

This project contains all the code for the webpage of the nonprofit Spay & Neuter Nation. Currently there is no domain for the code, but the domain has alerady been bought and the code will be posted to spayneuternation.com when it is completed.

The main HTML is in `index.html`. `default.css` is the main stylesheet, while `fonts.css` contains the code for handling the social media icons. _images_ contains all the images used on the webpage and _fonts_ contains more code for handling fonts, which was downloaded from FontAwesome and w3.org. The client said she wanted "a front page where I could put the best memes, similar to my facebook page" with other pages for more information on her nonprofit. All pictures were taken from the Spay & Neuter Nation Facebook page with permission. This is a working webpage with room for changes.

Spay & Neuter Nation is a nonprofit focused on catch and release spay and neutering of feral cats and dogs as well as educating the public on low-cost spay and neuter clinics.
